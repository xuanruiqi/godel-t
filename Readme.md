# Godel's System T
A simple interpreter for Godel's System T that actually works a bit, but the parsing is still 
pretty terrible. But yes, you could do some primitive recursion in it.  

## Building
`idris build lamt.ipkg`

## Acknowledgements
I took some code (mainly in `Parse`) from Edwin Brady himself.
